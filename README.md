# Growth of a Population

Once upon a time, there was a small town. Every year, the town saw a steady increase in its population due to both a regular growth and the arrival of new residents.

Years went by and the town continued to flourish and grow. One day, the town's leaders noticed that the population had surpassed a certain number of residents. They wondered how many years it took for the town to reach this milestone.

Challenge: Write a function to determine the number of years required for a town's population to reach a target number, given the following parameters:

1.-Start population: The initial number of residents in the town.

2.-Percentage of annual increase: The regular increase in the town's population each year, expressed as a percentage.

3.-Arrival or Leaving: The net change in the town's population each year due to people moving in or out.

4.-Population to achieve: The target population the town aims to reach.

The function should take in the above parameters and return the number of years it will take for the town to reach the target population
